We were tasked with the creation of the Pencraft App, and we can happily say we
have done it successfully, although we deviated from our initial plans, we added 
a lot more functionalities.
We used React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the Backend and MongoDB 
for the Database which were the best for what we wanted to do as it had many 
eases of function and layered coding styles. The Pencraft is a combination of 
Javascript, CSS, HTML and JSX technologies with the emphasis being placed on 
Javascript as that is our strongpoint. We also made use of a lot of modules such 
as react-router-dom, mui etc. The purpose of this Documentation is to explain 
how to run the project on other systems as well as how we decided to code 
things and how we decided to go through with our project.

.

2.Prerequisites:
Node.js, Mongo, Node package manager

  .



3.Installation:

This is to explain how to run the code on other people’s systems and how to 
access the database.
First, you’ll need to install the project code, it’s a large file so you’ll need to unzip
it before you use it. 
Then Download the prerequisites, which includes Node.js, Node package 
Manager and MongoDB, you’ll also need to download the MongoDB GUI in order 
to easily access the database and edit it.
Next, you’ll need to start the Frontend server, Backend Server, and Database 
Server, which means navigating inside the MongoDB bin were the “mongod.exe
file” and then starting the Database Server using “./mongod.exe --port 27017”. 
This then starts the database on localhost:27017 which can be accessed by 
connecting to it using the MongoDB GUI
Then you start the Frontend server on one terminal, and the Backend Server 
terminal on the other and run “npm install --force” which installs all the 
dependencies on the package.json file and then “npm start” on both which starts
the frontend and backend server and can be accessed on the Localhost.
You can then use the Frontend GUI to register and Login.

4.Architecture and Technologies:


4.1 Frontend Technologies:

 4.1.1 HTML/CSS: User interface design and style will be done using 
HTML/CSS.
This was responsible for the amazing design we implemented and the 
animations and user ease of access.
 4.1.2 JavaScript: Explanation on how JavaScript improves the interactivity 
of the applications. This is responsible for the functionality of the frontend,
this is what we used to make the frontend work, from fetching the APIs to 
the use of JSON tokens
 4.1.3 React: Implementing the interface components for the system using 
the React framework.

4.2 Backend Technologies:

 4.2.1 Node.js: Node.js here is used for executing the backend services. 
This is what we used to define the APIs and give it routes so that the 
frontend can access it and use its functions.
 4.2.2 Backend Support: The process whereby the Express framework gives
back-end support for the application in the management of the server-side
logic.
 4.2.3 Integration of Database (MongoDB/SQL) – The explanation of 
database integration that would be outlined to manage the data. This is 
used to store the author, writings, category, notifications, and stats 
schema which is used to fetch and store data of each.

.


Conclusion:
We decided to use a Space theme to encompass the vast knowledge that this 
web application can store and retrieve. The things we could have improved on 
were more error handling, GUI and more functionalities such as the notification 
schema being improved, better animation, Google and other social media

platforms integration etc. This Project gave use the opportunity to implement 
what we learnt, and we hope we can improve on it
